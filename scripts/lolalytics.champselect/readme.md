## How to use

1. Install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) if you haven't already.
2. Install lcu-connector:
   ```bash
   npm install lcu-connector
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   node lola_champselect.js
   ```

4. Open the League of Legends client and start a game.
5. The script will automatically find the currently selected champion and open its Lolalytics page.

### Note

I haven't checked all URL's. I currently just autoconvert them from the champions.json file. If you find any broken links, please let me know.
