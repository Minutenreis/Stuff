== Tasks

Each Cell needs to know:

* [ ] If it is a mine
* [ ] If it is flagged
* [ ] If it is revealed
* [ ] If it is questioned
* [ ] How many mines are surrounding it

ToDo:

* [ ] Generate Grid with randomised mines (-1) [do this after the first click, if the first click is a mine, move it to a different cell]
* [ ] Generate Numbers based on surrounding mines (0-8)
* [ ] create "click" function that
** [ ] reveals cell if not a mine
** [ ] reveals all surrounding cells if cell is 0 (queue? recursion?)
** [ ] ends game if cell is a mine
* [ ] create "flag" function that
** [ ] if cell is not flagged and not questioned, flag it
** [ ] if cell is flagged, question and unflag it
** [ ] if cell is questioned, unquestion it
** [ ] ends game if all mines are flagged
** [ ] updates mine count (important: there have to be 2 mine counts, one visible for the player and one to actually check if the game is won)
* [ ] create "new game" function that
** [ ] resets the grid
** [ ] resets the mine count
** [ ] resets the clock
* [ ] create "end game" function that
** [ ] stops the clock
** [ ] reveals all mines
** [ ] disables all cells
** [ ] shows a message if the game was won or lost
* [ ] create "save highscore" function
** [ ] saves the time of the player if the game was won and the player is in the top 5
** [ ] writes the new highscore table to disk
* [ ] create "load highscore" function
** [ ] reads the highscore table from disk
* [ ] add "ask AI for help" function
** [ ] needs to logically check the revealed grid for mines / save cells
* [ ] generate GUI
** [ ] add timer
** [ ] add mine counter
** [ ] add new game button
** [ ] add end game button
** [ ] add grid
