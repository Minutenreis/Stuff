Each Cell needs to know:

* [x] How many mines are surrounding it

Done: 

* [x] Generate Grid with randomised mines (-1) [do this before the first click, if the first click is a mine, move it to a different cell]
* [x] Generate Numbers based on surrounding mines (0-8)
* [x] create "click" function that
** [x] reveals cell if not a mine
** [x] reveals all surrounding cells if cell is 0 (queue? recursion?)
** [x] ends game if cell is a mine
* [x] create "flag" function that
** [x] if cell is not flagged and not questioned, flag it
** [x] if cell is flagged, question and unflag it
** [x] if cell is questioned, unquestion it
** [x] updates mine count
* [x] create "new game" function that
** [x] resets the grid
** [x] resets the mine count
** [x] resets the clock
* [x] create "end game" function that
** [x] stops the clock
** [x] reveals all mines
** [x] disables all cells
** [x] shows a message if the game was won or lost
* [x] create "save highscore" function
** [x] saves the time of the player if the game was won and the player is in the top 5
** [x] writes the new highscore table to disk
* [x] create "load highscore" function
** [x] reads the highscore table from disk
* [x] generate GUI
** [x] add difficulty selection
** [x] add highscore table
** [x] add timer
** [x] add mine counter
** [x] add new game button
** [x] add end game button
** [x] add grid
*** [x] add click function to grid (lmb)
*** [x] add flag function to grid (rmb)
*** [x] display number if 1-8, nothing if 0, mine if -1
*** [x] display flag if flagged

ToDo:

* [ ] add "ask AI for help" function
** [ ] needs to logically check the revealed grid for mines / save cells
*** [ ] First Try: Check each revealed field
**** if all its mines are flagged, if so reveal all other fields
**** if the number of unflagged mines is equal to the number of hidden fields, flag all hidden fields
