=== 13.2.1

Variant 1: 1s (Stride 1)
Variant 2: 2s (Stride 2), has to load everything twice
Variant 3: 4s (Stride 4), has to load everything four times
Variant 4: 8s (Stride 8), has to load everything eight times
Variant 5: 16s (Stride 16), has to load everything eight times because 8 x 16 = 128 > 64 => for each calculation a new cache line has to be loaded anyways

Hypothesis: We don't see a large decrepency between Method 1 and 2 because its able to prefetch the next cache line fast enough to not impact performance
